{"name":"echidna","tagline":"Sets limits better than our egg-laying mammal friends","body":"echidna\r\n=======\r\n\r\nechidna is a limit setting and spectrum fitting tool. It aims to create a fast flexible platform providing the tools for a variety of limit-setting and fitting based analyses.\r\n\r\nGetting started with echidna\r\n----------------------------\r\n\r\nWhether you want to contribute to development or just use the latest release, this is the place to start.\r\n\r\nDownloading echidna\r\n-------------------\r\n\r\nIf you just want the latest release, there are two main options:\r\n\r\n* [download](https://github.com/snoplusuk/echidna/releases/latest) the latest release from GitHub\r\n* Clone the repository from the command line\r\n\r\n    $ git clone -b \"v0.1-alpha\" git@github.com:snoplusuk/echidna.git\r\n\r\nHowever if you plan on developing echidna, the best option is to fork the main\r\nechidna repository and then clone your fork\r\n\r\n    $ git clone git@github.com:yourusername/echidna.git\r\n\r\nSoftware Requirements\r\n---------------------\r\n\r\nIn order run echidna some extra python modules are required. The software and corresponding version numbers required listed in requirements.txt. To install all packages using pip run\r\n\r\n    $ pip install -r requirements.txt\r\n\r\nNote: you may need root access to install some modules.\r\n\r\nRunning echidna\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nYou should now have a working copy of echidna. You can get started straight away by using some of the example scripts. Example scripts are located in `echidna/scripts/`. To run example scripts you must set your python path to\r\n\r\n    $ export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$(pwd)\r\n\r\nfrom the echidna base directory. Details on how to run individual scripts can be found in their respective documentation.\r\n\r\nDocumentation\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nA copy of the latest version of the HTML documentation is available [here](echidna/blob/gh-pages/docs/html/docs/index.html)\r\n\r\nBut if you prefer you can build a copy of the Sphinx-based documentation locally. To build HTML documentation:\r\n\r\n    $ cd docs\r\n    $ make html\r\n\r\nOutput is placed in `docs/html/docs`. This documentation is built using the napoleon extension to sphinx, which allows the google style comments.\r\n\r\nNote: After updating code be sure to run in the base directory\r\n    \r\n    $ sphinx-apidoc -f -H echidna -o docs echidna/\r\n    $ cd docs\r\n    $ make html\r\n\r\nTesting\r\n-------\r\nTo test the code is working as expected run\r\n\r\n    $ python -m unittest discover echidna/test/\r\n\r\nfrom the base directory.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
